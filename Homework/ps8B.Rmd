This homework assignment is designed to help you further ingest, practice, and expand upon the material covered in class over the past week(s).  You are encouraged to work with other students, but all code and text must be written by you, and you must indicate below who you discussed the assignment with (if anyone).  

Steps to proceed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In RStudio, go to File > Open Project, navigate to the folder with the course-content repo, select the course-content project (course-content.Rproj), and click "Open" 
\item Pull the course-content repo (e.g. using the blue-ish down arrow in the Git tab in upper right window)
\item Copy ps8B.Rmd from the course repo to your repo (see page 6 of the GitHub Classroom Guide for Stat231 if needed)
\item Close the course-content repo project in RStudio
\item Open YOUR repo project in RStudio
\item In the ps8B.Rmd file in YOUR repo, replace "YOUR NAME HERE" with your name
\item Add in your responses, committing and pushing to YOUR repo in appropriate places along the way
\item Run "Knit PDF" 
\item Upload the pdf to Gradescope.  Don't forget to select which of your pages are associated with each problem.  \textit{You will not get credit for work on unassigned pages (e.g., if you only selected the first page but your solution spans two pages, you would lose points for any part on the second page that the grader can't see).} 
\end{enumerate}

# 1. Mapping spatial data 

Reproduce the map you created for Lab08-spatial (and finish it if you didn't in class). In 2-4 sentences, interpret the visualization.  What stands out as the central message?  

NOTE: you do NOT need to say what colors are representing what feature (e.g, NOT:  "In this map, I've colored the countries by GDP, with green representing low values and red representing high values") -- this is obvious to the viewer, assuming there's an appropriate legend and title.  Rather, what *information* do you extract from the visualization? (e.g., "From the choropleth below, we can see that the percent change in GDP per capita  between 1957-2007 varies greatly across countries in Central America.  In particular, Panama and Costa Rica stand out as having GDPs per capita that increased by over 200% across those 50 years.  In contrast, Nicaragua's GDP per capita decreased by a small percentage during that same time span.")

> ANSWER:  From the map, we can see that countries that have the highest GDP per capita in the world in 2007 lies in North America, Central Europe and Western Europe and Australia, while those with the lowest GDP per capita can be found in Central and East Africa and South and Central Asia. There are also a lot of countries and regions with missing data, namely those that used to belong in the Soviet Union bloc. The overall message we get from the map is that in 2007 there is huge inequality of wealth internationally, as there are countries like Norway and the US that have annual GDP per capita of higher than 40000, but a large part of the world are still struggling with GDP per capita less than 10000. 

```{r}
# Load the world map and create gap_minder dataset for usage
world_map <- map_data(map = "world"
                      , region = ".")
gap_minder <- gapminder::gapminder

gdp_cons <- gap_minder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  select(country,gdpPercap) %>%
  # renaming countries with different names from that in the world_map dataset for matching
  mutate(renamed = case_when(country == "United States" ~ "USA",
                             country == "Congo, Dem.Rep." ~ "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
                             country == "Cote d'Ivoire" ~ "Ivory Coast",
                             country == "Yemen, Rep." ~ "Yemen",
                             country == "Korea, Rep." ~ "South Korea",
                             country == "Korea, Dem. Rep." ~ "North Korea",
                             country == "United Kingdom" ~ "UK",
                             TRUE ~ as.character(country)))

world_map_2 <- left_join(world_map,gdp_cons, by = c("region" = "renamed"))

test <- gdp_cons %>%
  filter(gdpPercap > 40000)


ggplot(world_map_2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group
                      , fill = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.3) +
  labs(title = "GDP per capita of countries in the world"
       , subtitle = "as of 2007"
       , caption = "* Countries or regions in grey have no data"
       , fill = "") +

# 2. Mapping spatial data at a different level

Create a map at the world, country, or county level based on the choices provided in lab08-spatial, that is at a DIFFERENT level than the map you created for the lab (and included above).  For instance, if you created a map of US counties for the lab, then choose a country or world map to create here.

Note: While I recommend using one of the datasets provided in the lab so you don't spend a lot of time searching for data, you are not strictly required to use one of those datasets.  You could, for instance, create a static map that might be relevant to your project (so long as it's at a different level than your map above).  

Describe one challenge you encountered (if any) while creating this map.

# 3. Ethics follow-up

(a) Thinking about the discussion you had with the first group you were with during class last Thursday (focused on either "Predicting Policing & Recidivism" or "Predicting Financial Risk"), did your perspective on, or understanding of, any of the questions shift?  If so, please describe.  If not, was there anything you found surprising in the resources or your first group discussion?

(b) Thinking about the discussion you had with the second group you were with during class last Thursday (focused on considering the use of algorithms in the college admissions processs), did your perspective on, or understanding of, the use of algorithms in these contexts shift?  If not, was there anything you found surprising in the resources or your second group discussion?
